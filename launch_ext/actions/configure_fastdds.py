    Configure Fast DDS middleware for ROS 2 nodes with support for different discovery protocols.
    
    This class sets up the Fast DDS configuration profile and optionally starts a Discovery Server
    process based on the provided parameters. It creates configuration XML files using Xacro 
    templates and sets the appropriate environment variables to use these configurations.
    
    The class supports three discovery protocols:
    - SIMPLE: Direct peer-to-peer discovery (standard DDS discovery)
    - CLIENT: Discovery Server client mode (clients connect to a discovery server)
    - SUPER_CLIENT: Discovery Server super client mode (acts as both client and can distribute discovery info)
